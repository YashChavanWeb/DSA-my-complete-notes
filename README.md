# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

This repository contains my notes and implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms topics in C++.

## Folders (keeps on updating)

1. **Basics**: This folder contains basic data structures and algorithms concepts.

2. **STL (Standard Template Library)**: This folder covers the usage of standard template library containers and algorithms.

3. **Basic Maths**: Here, you'll find implementations of basic mathematical algorithms used frequently in competitive programming and problem-solving.

## Topics Covered

### Basics
- Input/Output
- Control Structures (If-else, Switch)
- Loops (For, While, Do-While)
- Pattern Printing
- Functions
- Time and Space Complexity

### STL (Standard Template Library)
- Vector
- List
- Deque
- Stack
- Queue
- Priority Queue
- Set
- Map
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)

### Basic Maths
- Prime Numbers
- Factorization
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
- LCM (Least Common Multiple)
- Modular Arithmetic

## Usage
Each topic folder contains C++ source files (.cpp) with implementations and sometimes accompanying header files (.h). You can compile and run these files using any C++ compiler.

Feel free to explore the code and use it for your learning purposes. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
